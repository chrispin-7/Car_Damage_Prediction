# 🚗 Car Damage Detection & Classification

This project uses deep learning to detect and classify car damage from images. It combines a **ResNet18 classifier** to identify the type of damage and a **YOLOv8 object detector** to localize the damaged areas with bounding boxes — all wrapped in an interactive **Streamlit web app**.
